    :description: How to match documents to the style, formatting, and tone of craft apps

Starcraft style guide
=====================

This is the style guide for user and developer documentation in the craft apps and
libraries. It's a supplement to the `Canonical Documentation Style Guide
<https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide>`__.


Tone
----

Starcraft is for developers, which means Starcraft is for humans. In our tone we must
never forget we're speaking directly to the person behind the device.

Here are fundamentals for the persona we adopt when speaking to the user. They're the
foundation for our style:

- We write, primarily, as teachers and guides. We provide for the user's understanding,
  and guide their work.
- We are the team behind the Starcraft products. We take responsibility for them.
- Let that which is exciting, inspiring, and interesting come across on the page. If
  technology has this effect on you, allow it to come out in your writing.
- Documentation is one side of an ongoing dialogue with the user. Dialogue is
  conversation, so write directly and straightforwardly, in plain language. Write like
  the user will respond to you directly -- they often do.
- Be brief. The user's time and attention is a gift they don't hand out lightly. Be
  responsible with it. Don't squander it.
- In the course of events, identify the person in the loop. Humans come to decisions,
  have opinions, and make mistakes. Processes, systems, and machines don't.
- Many ideas in computing are abstract, metaphorical, and even at times whimsical. If it
  helps the user understand, use analogy and metaphor. Grounding an idea in a familiar
  concept is an effective technique for communicating abstract and complex ideas.
- When something is difficult, acknowledge the pain it causes.
- When something is uncertain, be forthcoming about why.


Inclusivity
-----------


Singular *they* and *them*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't presume a gender when referring to a nominal or anonymous person:

    Once he installs the app

    Wait for the user to make her choice

Do use singular third-person pronouns:

    Once they install the app

    Wait for the user to make their choice


Names for people
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use gendered names in examples or placeholders:

    Alice

    Bob

    Carol

    David

Do use unisex names:

    Alex

    Blair

    Cam

    Devin


Accessibility
-------------


Image alt text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All images must have alt text. The `W3C Images Tutorial
<https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/>`__ provides complete guidance for how to
write one.


Relative positioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't refer to relative positions and directions:

    The above example

    The code below

    The **Render** node at the bottom-right of the chart

Do refer to chronological sequence, linear sequence, or the item itself:

    The previous example

    The following code

    The **Render** node

The user is able to locate elements in space in multiple senses. Relative positions in a
document, a graphic, or an interface are likely to change, therefore documenting them
precisely increases maintenance debt. They also aren't helpful when the page is recited
by a screen reader.


Names
-----


Product names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't modify the product names, even if it's grammatical:

    Starcraft's

    Starcrafts

    Starcrafty

Do keep product names discrete and unaltered:

    Starcraft


Version names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use special formatting for version names:

    Starcraft ``9``

    Starcraft v9.0.1

Use regular formatting instead:

    Starcraft 9

    Starcraft 9.0.1

Don't refer to changes in time when referring to a range of versions:

    Starcraft 8 or newer

    earlier than core26

Use *higher* and *lower* instead:

    Starcraft 8 or higher

    lower than core26


Software and package names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't format software and package names as code:

    download and install ``curl``

    the ``firefox`` snap

    ``core26``

Do write software names in plain English, using the spelling provided by the authors:

    download and install curl

    the Firefox snap

    core26

Some commands, programs, and library names have become generic as verbs, tools, or
products. For example, sudo and grep started as packages but have since entered common
parlance.


Feature and component names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't format feature and component names as code:

    the ``python`` plugin

    the ``gnome`` extension

Do format feature and component names plainly:

    the Python plugin

    the GNOME extension

The rule of thumb is, do you always qualify the name as belonging to the class of the
feature? In other words, does it fit the pattern *the [name] [feature type]*? If yes, it
should be formatted normally.


Code unit names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't refer to code unit names without context:

    call ``setup()``

    if your package doesn't have a ``name``

Do qualify what the name is to disambiguate it:

    call the ``setup()`` method

    if your package's ``name`` key isn't set


Links
-----

The prose of a document should be naturally-flowing, plain English. Whenever a link
appears in the text, it threatens to harm that flow, because a link is an invitation to
go somewhere else. Carefully consider:

- How the link fits into the context of the preceding discussion. Does the text
  naturally lead to this link? Does it feel like it *belongs*? If you were having a
  conversation with a friend, and they pushed their phone up to your face without
  warning, it would be quite rude. That's what an unexpected link feels like on the
  page.
- What *benefit* the user gets from the link. A link is a call to action. But there are
  many actions the user could take in a document, including skipping the link. Does the
  link's text, and the text surrounding it, help the user decide whether to click on it?
- If you start writing "See [link] for more details", don't. That sentence is of no help
  to the user. Instead, consider how to invite, or call, the user to click on the link.

Don't set high expectations or make promises you can't keep with a link:

    You can visit `Migrations
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/migrations/>`__ in the Django
    documentation to learn how to

Do straightforwardly describe what's at the other end of the link:

    `Migrations <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/migrations/>`__ in the
    Django documentation describes how to

It's better to be descriptive. You can't guarantee that a link will provide positive
benefits like learning and discovery.


External link format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For named external links, avoid end-of-file links:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    `Migrations`__

    # Rest of document...

    .. _Migrations: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/migrations/

Prefer the inline format, with two underscores (_):

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

  `Migrations <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/migrations/>`__

In long documents, the source is more readable, comprehensible, and easier to maintain
when external links are declared in the same location as they're used. Internal
references are formatted inline, so the authoring experience is more congruent with this
pattern.

The double underscore blocks Sphinx from making the external link into a named
reference.


.. _how-to-starcraft-style-guide-examples-good-links:

Examples of good links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A link to another site:

    Discuss your ideas on the `Snapcraft forum <https://forum.snapcraft.io>`__.

A link to an action in another how-to guide:

    First, `install Brew <https://brew.sh#install>`__.

A link to a different section in the documentation:

    Without such a connection, the snap fails to build. Guidance on sourcing information
    is available in :ref:`External package information
    <how-to-starcraft-style-guide-examples-good-links>`.

A link to another documentation set:

    The ``snap`` command itself has many diagnostic features that can help with
    debugging runtime and configuration errors. `Debugging snaps
    <https://snapcraft.io/docs/debug-snaps>`__ in the SnapD documentation covers how and
    when to use them.


Reference labels
----------------

Format Sphinx labels as:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. _<diataxis-type>-<page-title>-<id>

For example:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. _how-to-starcraft-style-guide-sphinx-labels

Within a documentation set, every label must be unique. A systematic and semantic
approach reduces the chances for collisions and makes identification by humans much
easier.

Between documentation sets, they may be connected through Intersphinx. The namespaces of
every connected documentation set are pooled. It's possible to have collisions if one
set refers to another through a ``:ref:`` lookup instead of ``:external+<set>:ref:``.


Admonitions
-----------

Wherever possible, avoid admonitions, also known as callouts, like notes, tips,
cautions, and warnings. They compete for the user's attention and become noise when
overused. Aim for at most one in a document.

Prefer the generic admonition type:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. admonition:: If you're thinking about using an admonition
        :class: tip

        Try writing a plain paragraph first.

The message you put in the admonition becomes meaningful for its time and place, which
is much more helpful to the user than a generic, context-free *Tip*.


Code blocks and quotations
--------------------------

The purpose of code in documentation is to make bare the literal words and expressions
that have effect in the software. Format code in contexts when you expect the user to
immediately make use of it.

Use as little code as possible. Readers have complete availability of our source code.
They come to the documentation to read in a natural language.


Code directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``code-block`` directive for code blocks, and always include the language:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. code-block:: bash

        ls -la

If no language applies, then the text probably isn't code, and different markup is
needed.


Error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't quote error messages and statuses as code:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. code-block::

        Code: macaroon-permission-required

Use the terminal directive instead:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. terminal::
        :output-only:

        Code: macaroon-permission-required


File paths
----------

Format file paths in text like this:

    ``/directory/from/root/``

    ``relative/directory/``

    ``path/to/file``

    ``path/to/file.ext``

There are many files in Linux that don't have extensions, such as ``/bin/bash`` and
``~/.gitconfig``. Including the final slash makes it less ambiguous about whether we're
describing a file or a directory.


Punctuation and symbols
-----------------------


Colons and semicolons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid colons and semicolons inside paragraphs:

    There was only one thing to do: dance.

    It was cold; I ran home.

Do use full stops:

    There was only one thing to do. Dance.

    It was cold. I ran home.

The grammar rules for when to use semicolons, colons, and commas vary between regions
and writers. It's easier to sidestep them completely.

Colons and semicolons are difficult to see when skimming, and are a barrier for blind
users and those with vision impairment.

Use colons to connect to an element on the next line:

    Run the following commands to clear the cache:


Quotation marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use quotation marks to cite terms, borrowed words, names, or titles:

    also known as "crafting" a package

    according to "Design Patterns"

Do use emphasis instead:

    also known as *crafting* a snap

    according to *Design Patterns*

Quotation marks around words can sound insincere or sarcastic. Many cultures and
languages don't use them, so their meaning can be lost.


Non-linguistic symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use symbols as shorthand:

    ✔

    ✕

    🚀

Do use single words:

    Yes

    No

    Launched

Symbol meaning varies across cultures and languages. Symbols aren't always compatible in
screen readers.
